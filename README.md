# budget

## running the app
to run from eclipse ide, right click on appLauncher class and run as java application
dont know why but it resolves module error ' like

cannot access class com.sun.javafx.charts.Legend (in module javafx.controls) 

because module javafx.controls does not export com.sun.javafx.charts to unnamed module @0x3f7df121
	at mesh.budget.controller.MainController.showBarChart2(MainController.java:196)
