cant see from dev tool what causes the file download


I think the button hooks to  a locla script but I cant folloq it


Considering automating withe selenium

bash script
clear downloads
dat range vars
call seelnium, selenium downloads for given data range?

then load into xls from download susing excel dynamic data loder?



=====

to run seleium from command line, from a powershell window, run 

selenium-side-runner -c "browserName=chrome"  --output-directory=results  C:\Users\patri\git\budget\asb.side\

- so run from browser, then a script to proess hte downloads
